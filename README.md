Stream games from a headless Sway session using [Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine) and [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/), without disrupting your main desktop session.

This setup runs a separate headless Wayland compositor (Sway) dedicated to game streaming. Your primary desktop (Hyprland, GNOME, etc.) continues running normally — audio, display, and input are fully isolated.

## Why headless?

- Stream games without taking over your main display
- Dynamic resolution matching — the headless output adapts to your Moonlight client
- Game audio routes only to the stream, host audio is unaffected
- Works with NVIDIA GPUs using NVENC hardware encoding
- Minimal overhead when idle (~420MB RAM, negligible CPU)

## Requirements

- **OS**: Linux with systemd user services (tested on CachyOS/Arch and Ubuntu 25.10)
- **GPU**: Any modern GPU with hardware encoding support (NVENC for NVIDIA, VCN for AMD)
- **Packages**: `sway`, `swaybg`, `pipewire`, `wireplumber`, `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`
- **Sunshine**: [LizardByte Sunshine](https://github.com/LizardByte/Sunshine/releases) v2026.226+ (deb for Ubuntu, `sunshine` AUR package for Arch)
- **Client**: [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) on any device

## Quick install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dabiggm0e/sunshine-headless-sway.git
cd sunshine-headless-sway
./install.sh
```

The install script will:
- Install missing dependencies (`sway`, `swaybg`, `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`) via pacman or apt
- Auto-detect your desktop environment (Hyprland or GNOME) for input isolation
- Auto-detect your Sunshine installation path
- Detect the correct Wayland display number and user ID
- Template all config files with your system's paths
- Install and enable the systemd services
- Preserve any existing Sunshine config you already have

## Manual setup

If you prefer to install manually, see the [manual setup guide](#manual-setup-guide) below.

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Main Desktop (Hyprland/GNOME)     wayland-0        │
│  └─ Normal apps, browser, etc.                      │
│  └─ Audio → your speakers/headphones                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Headless Sway                     wayland-1        │
│  └─ Games launched via Sunshine                     │
│  └─ Audio → sink-sunshine-stereo → Moonlight stream │
│  └─ Video → wlr-screencopy → hardware encoder → Moonlight │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two systemd user services manage the stack:

1. **`sway-sunshine.service`** — runs a headless Sway compositor with no physical display
2. **`sunshine-headless.service`** — runs Sunshine pointed at the headless Sway session

## Adding games

Edit `~/.config/sunshine/apps.json` to add games. The install script provides templates for Steam and Lutris. Find Steam app IDs on [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/).

### Steam games

```json
{
  "name": "Game Name",
  "detached": [
    "~/.config/sway-sunshine/start-steam-game.sh <appid>"
  ],
  "prep-cmd": [
    {"do": "~/.config/sway-sunshine/restore-default-sink.sh", "undo": ""},
    {"do": "~/.config/sway-sunshine/set-resolution.sh", "undo": "~/.config/sway-sunshine/stop-steam-game.sh"}
  ]
}
```

### Lutris games

```json
{
  "name": "Game Name (Lutris)",
  "detached": [
    "~/.config/sway-sunshine/start-lutris-game.sh <slug_or_id>"
  ],
  "prep-cmd": [
    {"do": "~/.config/sway-sunshine/restore-default-sink.sh", "undo": ""},
    {"do": "~/.config/sway-sunshine/set-resolution.sh", "undo": "~/.config/sway-sunshine/stop-lutris-game.sh"}
  ]
}
```

### Bulk import with LutrisToSunshine

For bulk importing from multiple launchers, this repo bundles [LutrisToSunshine](https://github.com/Arbitrate3280/LutrisToSunshine) ([MIT](./LutrisToSunshine/LICENSE)) — a CLI tool that scans installed game launchers and imports games into Sunshine with optional cover art from SteamGridDB.

**Supported launchers:** Lutris (native + Flatpak), Heroic (Legendary, GOG, Nile, Sideload — native + Flatpak), Bottles, Steam, Faugus, Ryubing, RetroArch, Eden.

```bash
cd LutrisToSunshine
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 lutristosunshine.py --all --cover --force
```

Use `--all` to skip the selection prompt, `--cover` to download SteamGridDB artwork, and `--force` to overwrite existing entries. The tool detects whether Sunshine or Apollo is running and adds games via the API.

> **Tip:** After importing, run `./install.sh` to auto-migrate any `lutristosunshine-launch-app.sh` entries to use the repo's `start-lutris-game.sh` scripts.

Restart Sunshine after editing: `systemctl --user restart sunshine-headless.service`

## How it works

### Headless Sway renderer

The Sway service uses `WLR_RENDERER=gles2` by default for maximum compatibility. For better rendering performance on modern wlroots versions (0.20+), you can try `WLR_RENDERER=vulkan`.

> **Note:** wlroots 0.19.3 has a known bug with the Vulkan renderer on the `headless` backend causing XR24 format errors. Use gles2 if you're on wlroots 0.19.3. The stream may work despite these errors if frame capture succeeds.

### Audio isolation

Game audio is routed exclusively to the Moonlight stream without touching your host audio:

- A persistent PipeWire null sink (`sink-sunshine-stereo`) is created via config drop-in — it always exists, even when Moonlight is disconnected or backgrounded
- `PULSE_SINK=sink-sunshine-stereo` is set in the Sway service environment, so apps launched in the headless session output to this sink
- `audio_sink = sink-sunshine-stereo` in `sunshine.conf` tells Sunshine to capture from that sink
- `restore-default-sink.sh` runs as a prep command to prevent Sunshine from hijacking your host's default audio sink — it detects the change and restores it within seconds
- When Moonlight is backgrounded, game audio stays in the persistent null sink (silent) instead of reverting to your host speakers
- Your main desktop audio continues through your normal output device

### Dynamic resolution

When a Moonlight client connects, Sunshine runs `set-resolution.sh` as a prep command. This uses `SUNSHINE_CLIENT_WIDTH`, `SUNSHINE_CLIENT_HEIGHT`, and `SUNSHINE_CLIENT_FPS` environment variables to resize the headless output to match the client exactly. On disconnect, `reset-resolution.sh` reverts to 1080p.

### Multi-GPU setup

This setup works with both single-GPU and dual-GPU systems. On multi-GPU setups, two environment variables control GPU selection:

- **`WLR_DRM_DEVICES`** in `sway-sunshine.service` — tells Sway which render node to use for rendering
- **`adapter_name`** in `sunshine.conf` — tells Sunshine which render node to use for importing frames via DMA-BUF

Both should point to the same GPU (the one where Sway renders). On this specific setup, Sway renders on the NVIDIA GPU (`renderD129`) and `adapter_name` in sunshine.conf also points to `renderD129`. The encoding backend (NVENC on NVIDIA or VCN on AMD) is determined by Vulkan auto-selection unless `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` is explicitly set. On single-GPU systems, the defaults are usually correct. On multi-GPU systems, verify with:

```bash
ls -la /dev/dri/renderD*
ls -la /sys/class/drm/card*/device/vendor  # 0x10de = NVIDIA, 0x1002 = AMD
```

### Wayland display numbering

The headless Sway session typically gets `wayland-1` (assuming your main desktop is `wayland-0`). The install script detects this automatically. To check manually:

```bash
ls /run/user/$(id -u)/wayland-*
```

### IPC socket

Sway creates its IPC socket at the path specified by `SWAYSOCK` (`/run/user/<uid>/sway-sunshine.sock`). The service cleans up stale sockets on restart via `ExecStartPre`. All `swaymsg` commands in the apps and scripts reference this socket explicitly.

## Troubleshooting

### Blank display / error code -1

- Check `~/.config/sunshine/sunshine.log` for `Frame capture failed`
- Verify `WLR_DRM_DEVICES` in `sway-sunshine.service` points to the correct render node
- Verify `adapter_name` in `sunshine.conf` matches the render node where Sway renders
- Ensure Sunshine is connecting to the correct Wayland display

### Input isolation

Input is fully isolated between your desktop and the streaming session. Sunshine creates virtual input devices (vendor `0xBEEF`, product `0xDEAD`) that must be hidden from your host desktop while remaining accessible to the headless Sway session.

The install script **auto-detects your desktop environment** and installs the appropriate udev rule. Both approaches install to `/etc/udev/rules.d/85-sunshine-input-isolation.rules`.

#### GNOME (Mutter)

Uses the `mutter-device-ignore` property — a targeted GNOME-specific mechanism that tells Mutter to skip specific devices while leaving them visible to other consumers:

```udev
ACTION=="add|change", SUBSYSTEM=="input", ATTRS{id/vendor}=="beef", ATTRS{id/product}=="dead", ENV{mutter-device-ignore}="1"
```

#### Hyprland

Hyprland needs no udev rule. Sunshine's virtual devices are disabled on the host at runtime via `hyprctl` while the stream stack is up, and re-enabled when it stops:

```bash
hyprctl keyword "device[keyboard-passthrough]:enabled" false
```

Device names come from `hyprctl devices` (e.g. `keyboard-passthrough`, `mouse-passthrough`, `mouse-passthrough-(absolute)`). The bundled LutrisToSunshine display manager runs a small helper that polls `hyprctl -j devices`, matches Sunshine's passthrough devices by name, and keeps them disabled on the host for the duration of the streaming session.

#### How isolation works

- On GNOME, a **udev rule** prevents the host compositor from claiming Sunshine's virtual inputs; on **Hyprland** this is handled at runtime via `hyprctl` (see above)
- The headless Sway uses `WLR_BACKENDS=headless,libinput` with `LIBSEAT_BACKEND=noop` and runs under the `input` group via `sg` to access input devices without a logind seat
- The **Sway config** disables all physical host devices and only enables Sunshine's passthrough devices, so your physical keyboard and mouse don't leak into the streaming session
- Gamepads are read directly by Steam via evdev, bypassing the compositor entirely

#### Switching DE method manually

Hyprland needs no udev rule. If you switch to GNOME, install its rule:

```bash
# For GNOME
sudo cp udev/85-sunshine-input-isolation-gnome.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/85-sunshine-input-isolation.rules

# Reload
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=input
```

### No input / can't control games

- The `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` package must be installed
- Check that `/dev/uinput` is accessible to your user (Sunshine's udev rules should handle this)
- Verify the libinput backend is active: `SWAYSOCK=/run/user/$(id -u)/sway-sunshine.sock swaymsg -t get_inputs` should show Sunshine passthrough devices with `events: enabled`

### Games don't launch

- Verify the Sway IPC socket exists: `ls -la /run/user/$(id -u)/sway-sunshine.sock`
- Test manually: `SWAYSOCK=/run/user/$(id -u)/sway-sunshine.sock swaymsg -t get_tree`
- If the socket is stale after a restart, the `ExecStartPre` cleanup in the service handles it

### Audio bleeds to host

- Verify `audio_sink = sink-sunshine-stereo` is in `~/.config/sunshine/sunshine.conf`
- Check `PULSE_SINK=sink-sunshine-stereo` is in `sway-sunshine.service`
- Verify the `restore-default-sink.sh` prep command is in `apps.json` — without it, Sunshine sets `sink-sunshine-stereo` as the system-wide default, routing all host audio into the stream
- Confirm your default sink after connecting: `wpctl status | grep '\*'`

### UPnP port mapping failures

These errors (`Failed to map UDP/TCP`) are harmless if you're connecting over LAN or a VPN like Tailscale. They only matter for WAN connections through your router.

## Manual setup guide

If you'd rather not use the install script:

### 1. Install dependencies

**Arch / CachyOS:**
```bash
sudo pacman -S sway swaybg xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
```

**Ubuntu / Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt install sway swaybg xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
```

### 2. Copy config files

```bash
# Sway config and scripts
mkdir -p ~/.config/sway-sunshine
cp sway-sunshine/config ~/.config/sway-sunshine/
cp sway-sunshine/set-resolution.sh ~/.config/sway-sunshine/
cp sway-sunshine/reset-resolution.sh ~/.config/sway-sunshine/
chmod +x ~/.config/sway-sunshine/*.sh

# Sunshine config
cp sunshine/sunshine.conf ~/.config/sunshine/sunshine.conf
cp sunshine/apps.json ~/.config/sunshine/apps.json

# PipeWire persistent audio sink
mkdir -p ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d
cp pipewire/sunshine-null-sink.conf ~/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/
systemctl --user restart pipewire.service

# Systemd services
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp systemd/sway-sunshine.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
cp systemd/sunshine-headless.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
```

### 3. Edit paths

Update the following in the copied files to match your system:

- `sunshine-headless.service`: set `ExecStart` to your Sunshine path, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` to your headless display
- `sway-sunshine.service`: update `/run/user/1000/` to `/run/user/$(id -u)/` if your UID isn't 1000, set `WLR_DRM_DEVICES` to the correct render node
- `sunshine.conf`: set `adapter_name` to match the render node in `WLR_DRM_DEVICES`
- `apps.json`: update `/home/YOUR_USER/` to your home directory
- `set-resolution.sh` / `reset-resolution.sh`: update the socket path if your UID isn't 1000

### 4. Enable and start

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now sway-sunshine.service
systemctl --user enable --now sunshine-headless.service
```

### 5. Pair with Moonlight

Open Moonlight, find your host, and pair using the PIN at `https://YOUR_HOST:47990`.
